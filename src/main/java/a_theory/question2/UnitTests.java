    // What are unit tests? In your words (don't use wiki definitions)
    // Answer: unit tests are there to test a specific function or a class. 

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of unit tests
    // 1 They promote the Agile approach which allows for better scalability
    // 2 They are fast

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of unit tests
    // 1 the test results do not reflect how the system itself is going to function, only it only reflects the
    // functionality of it's separate parts

    //todo p4
    // Name 2 unit test frameworks or libraries
    // 1 JUnit
    // 2 Selenium

    //todo p5
    // Would you use mocking with unit tests?
    // Yes/No: Yes
    // Why? Because mocking a structure that the tested class/function uses would save a significant   
    // amount of time, which is ideal when you can potentially have hundreds of unit tests that are required to be
    // ran in succession.
