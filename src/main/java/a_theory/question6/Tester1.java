    //Acceptence testing - Is when the code has passed all the unit tests, integration tests, and
    //system tests and started being tested as if an average consumer would have used it, to
    //confirm if the end product matches users expectations.

    //this type of testing is mostly conducted manually 

    //todo p2
    // Second. Write the definition and explain what is it.
    //Security testing - Is when the created system is tested for it's potential misuse or shut down. 
    //These kinds of tests require analysis for possible vectors which would later become test cases.
    //For example one of potential cases could be unsanitised input fields, so tests for input security must be
    //implemented.
